* maybe some code cleanup? (cli.py is a smidge overpacked)
* `paper_meta.yml` could also be re-orged (maybe all paper data goes under one section and system data loose or under another?)
* could imagine passing it a param for what kind of output file to generate, maybe something in the metadata file? 
    - `docx` vs `pdf` vs `docx+pdf` (a PDF from Word instead of via LaTeX), for example
