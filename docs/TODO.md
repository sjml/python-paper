- could we do the doc munging with lua filters instead?

default vs code tasks for scaffolding template? 

can't get margins below tables due to limitations in how word table styles work ðŸ˜•
    - would work with a post-process by adding this bit of XML to each table definition to make it floating, but with "infinite" margins to the left and right... dubious, but recording here until/unless a better idea comes along
    - `<w:tblpPr w:leftFromText="31680" w:rightFromText="31680" w:bottomFromText="240" w:vertAnchor="text" w:tblpXSpec="center" w:tblpY="1"/><w:tblOverlap w:val="never"/>`
