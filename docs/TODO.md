* output templates:
    * docx:
        - list rendering in docx is a bit off -- I don't use it much/at all, but let's figure out for the sake of completion
    * LaTeX:
        - spacing on nested lists is borked
        - too much space after image caption
* nitpick
    - vulgate citations have to be spaced from their quote end, but other bible citations don't? WEIRD
        - maybe because they have a real cite on them?
    - document lua filters
* bonus
    - https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/stacked-area-plot/

### outside:
* make encyclical collection
* make vatican 2 collection (as elements of the published book)
