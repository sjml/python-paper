* maybe some code cleanup? (cli.py is a smidge overpacked)
    - lua naming conventions all over the place, global v local variables, require to variable?
    - see if we can move errors to warnings
* `paper_meta.yml` could also be re-orged (maybe all paper data goes under one section and system data loose or under another?)
* project template:
    - should "resources" become ".paper_resources"? hidden from the user, maybe
    - make other folders for notes/filters/resources/research/etc? -- basically a little project scaffold for academic work
* make "use ibid" into a variable, along with font selection so only needing one template doc
* list rendering is a bit off -- I don't use it much/at all, but let's figure out for the sake of completion


make encyclical collection
make vatican 2 collection (as elements of the published book)
