* have word count skip stuff in brackets?
* watcher functionality for word count
* maybe just watcher stuff in general? 
* portable version (use pyoxidizer?)
  * still runs into the problem of needing LaTeX installed... maybe can probe the environment at setup? hrm. 
* flag to skip title page (for anonymous submission)
  * probably need an alternate docx template... :-/
  * if no title given, derive it from filename? (PDF [and possibly docx] metadata still shows it...)
* save should exit earlier if it's not in a paper directory
* look at multiple footnotes (`\usepackage[multiple]{footmisc}` doesn't work because `footmisc` is already pulled in by the turabian package)
