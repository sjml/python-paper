* metadata files:
    - make font override selection a variable so only needing one template doc
* project template:
    - should "resources" become ".paper_resources"? hidden from the user, maybe
    - make other folders for notes/filters/resources/research/etc? -- basically a little project scaffold for academic work
* lua:
    - naming conventions all over the place, global v local variables, require to variable?
    - see if we can move errors to warnings
* output templates:
    - list rendering in docx is a bit off -- I don't use it much/at all, but let's figure out for the sake of completion


### outside:
* make encyclical collection
* make vatican 2 collection (as elements of the published book)
