* output templates:
    * docx:
        - list rendering in docx is a bit off -- I don't use it much/at all, but let's figure out for the sake of completion
    * LaTeX:
        - spacing on nested lists is borked
* filters
    - \noindent after blockquote to continue paragraph (or after table/figure presumably)
        - works natively in LaTeX; gets stripped in docx
* general
    - make sample document

### outside:
* make encyclical collection
* make vatican 2 collection (as elements of the published book)
