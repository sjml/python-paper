Citing the Vulgate the first time produces a footnote, as in "In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum." [@Bible-Vulgatam John 1:1] 

But a second citation becomes parenthetical with an italicized attribution as in "Qui non diligit, non novit Deum: quoniam Deus caritas est." [@Bible-Vulgatam 1 John 4:8]

The first time the Catechism gets cited, it's the full deal. [@CCC.2017 p45]

But what does Tommy Quine-Quine have to say about the same subject? [@aquinasSumma p48]

CCC with a stirring rebuttal! [@CCC.2017 p. 49] (Notice that it just becomes "CCC" on subsequents.)

That one was easy, because the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) has ready support for short titles, and since the Catechism doesn't have an *author* to list, it works out. What's trickier is the USCCB, which wants to get referenced by its full name the first time,[@usccb.PPF52006] but then afterwards gets "institutionally abbreviated."[@usccb.PPF52006] (Support for author short names is supposed to come in CSL 1.1, but there's no timetable on that, so gotta use [my little Lua filters](https://github.com/sjml/paper/tree/main/paper/resources/project_template/.paper_resources/filters) to get it done.)

Finally, give Tommy the final word,[@aquinasSumma I-II, Q. 12] and note the author drop from his subsequent citation.
